# RetinaPrep

**A curation and leakage-audit pipeline for retinal fundus datasets.**

Most published fundus-imaging results are reported on data that was split the
wrong way. This project measures how much that costs, on a public dataset, with
a fixed model and a controlled experiment.

The model here is deliberately boring. The data path is the contribution.

## Headline result

> *Filled in after the first experiment run. Do not write numbers here until
> they come out of `artifacts/results.json`.*

| Arm | Data | Split | AUROC | AUPRC | Sens @ 95% Spec |
|-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | raw | image-level random | – | – | – |
| B | raw | patient-level grouped | – | – | – |
| C | quality-curated | patient-level grouped | – | – | – |
| D | curated + deduplicated | patient-level grouped | – | – | – |

All arms use the same seed, the same ResNet18 hyperparameters, and matched
training-set sizes, so the only variable is the data path.

## Why patient-level splitting matters in ophthalmology specifically

Two reasons that do not apply as strongly in other imaging domains:

1. **Two eyes, one patient.** Most ocular disease is bilateral and correlated.
   A model that has seen the left eye has, in effect, seen much of the right.
   Under an image-level random split, roughly half of every patient's data can
   sit in train while the fellow eye sits in test.
2. **Repeat captures.** Clinical archives contain the same eye photographed
   more than once in a session and across visits. Near-duplicates cross a
   random split silently.

The result is an optimistic score that will not survive contact with a new
clinic's data.

## Pipeline

```
ingest   -> canonical manifest (one row per eye)
quality  -> gradability score, reject list
dedupe   -> perceptual hash + embedding near-duplicates
split    -> image_random (wrong) vs patient_group (right)
train    -> ResNet18 binary normal/abnormal
experiment -> arms A/B/C/D, matched sizes
report   -> self-contained HTML QC report
```

## Data card

| field | value |
|---|---|
| Dataset | ODIR-5K (Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition) |
| Source | Kaggle: `andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k` |
| Collected by | Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd., multiple centres in China |
| Size | ~5,000 patients, colour fundus photographs of both eyes |
| Cameras | Mixed (Canon, Zeiss, Kowa) — resolutions vary widely |
| Patient-level labels | N, D, G, C, A, H, M, O (8 classes) |
| Task here | Binary: normal vs abnormal |
| Licence | *Check the Kaggle page and record the exact terms here before publishing results.* |
| Known limitations | Class imbalance; labels are patient-level, not eye-level; camera confound across centres; annotation quality varies |

**Label derivation rule:** *documented here once implemented — state exactly how
the patient-level one-hot columns were mapped onto individual eyes, and the
disagreement rate against the per-eye diagnostic keyword strings.*

Images are **not** committed to this repository. See
[`scripts/download_data.sh`](scripts/download_data.sh).

## Environment setup

On Windows, use [`scripts/setup_env.ps1`](scripts/setup_env.ps1) rather than
the generic Quickstart below — it's documentation-as-script for exactly how
this project's dev environment is built, including the parts that are easy
to get wrong (torch is a separate, opt-in, 2-3 GB step; see
[Non-negotiable rules](CLAUDE.md) on staying CPU-first for everything except
`train`).

```powershell
# Anaconda users: run this first, however many envs are stacked.
conda deactivate

# Base env: .venv + requirements.txt (torch/torchvision excluded) + editable install.
.\scripts\setup_env.ps1

# When you're ready for GPU training (2-3 GB download, run on its own):
.\scripts\setup_env.ps1 -IncludeCudaTorch
```

Every command after this uses the venv's interpreter by **explicit path**,
not `activate` — a fresh shell doesn't inherit an activated venv, and this
project's own tooling was built assuming that:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m retinaprep ingest
```

Then check the environment itself with
[`scripts/doctor.py`](scripts/doctor.py) — Python version and interpreter
path, whether torch is installed and CUDA-capable, and (the check this
script exists for) whether the installed build actually still ships kernels
for this machine's GPU rather than merely reporting `cuda.is_available() ==
True`:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\doctor.py
```

It exits non-zero only on a real problem (e.g. GPU kernels missing for this
card's compute capability, or a matmul that fails despite CUDA reporting
available) — torch being absent, or the raw dataset not being downloaded
yet, are both normal states it reports without failing.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

bash scripts/download_data.sh          # needs a Kaggle API token, see the script

python -m retinaprep ingest
python -m retinaprep split
python -m retinaprep experiment --arm A
python -m retinaprep experiment --arm B
```

Override anything from the CLI:

```bash
python -m retinaprep train --set train.epochs=2 --set dataset.subsample_n=500
```

Run the tests, which need no dataset at all:

```bash
pytest
```

## Roadmap

Deliberately not built yet. Listed so the scope is honest rather than padded.

- [ ] U-Net optic disc and cup segmentation baseline (REFUGE, IDRiD)
- [ ] Mask and annotation QC: alignment, empty masks, area outliers, connected components
- [ ] Inter-grader agreement (Dice, IoU) using DRIVE's second-observer set
- [ ] DICOM PHI stripping and burned-in patient-text detection on the image itself
- [ ] Cross-camera domain shift audit via a site classifier
- [ ] EyePACS adapter to demonstrate the adapter layer generalises

---

## Repo layout

```
configs/default.yaml      every threshold and path
src/retinaprep/           the pipeline, one module per stage
  adapters/               one function per dataset
tests/                    synthetic fixtures, no download needed
scripts/download_data.sh  Kaggle fetch
artifacts/                all outputs (gitignored)
CLAUDE.md                 build instructions
WALKTHROUGH.md            design decisions + interview prep
```
